# dbus-next

The next great DBus library for NodeJS.

*This project is unreleased and is not ready to be used.*

## About

dbus-next is a fork of the wonderful [dbus-native](https://github.com/sidorares/dbus-native) library. While this library is fantastic, it has many bugs which I don't think can be fixed without completely redesigning the user API. Another library exists [node-dbus](https://github.com/Shouqun/node-dbus) which is similar, but this project requires compiling C code and similarly does not provide enough features to create full-featured DBus services.

Here are some goals for the project:

* Update the client interface with a modern ES6 interface
* Redesign the service interface
* Fix some outstanding bugs on the issue tracker

## The Service Interface

You can use the `Interface` class to define your interfaces. This interfaces uses the proposed [decorators syntax](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) which is not yet part of the ECMAScript standard, but should be included one day. Unfortunately, you'll need a [Babel plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators) to make this code work for now.

```js
let dbus = require('dbus-next');
let Variant = dbus.Variant;

let {
  Interface, property, method, signal, MethodError,
  ACCESS_READ, ACCESS_WRITE, ACCESS_READWRITE
} = dbus.interface;

let bus = dbus.sessionBus();

class ExampleInterface extends Interface {
  @property({signature: 's', access: ACCESS_READWRITE})
  SimpleProperty = 'foo';

  _MapProperty = {
    'foo': new Variant('s', 'bar'),
    'bat': new Variant('i', 53)
  };

  @property({signature: 'a{sv}'})
  get MapProperty() {
    return this._MapProperty;
  }

  set MapProperty(value) {
    this._MapProperty = value;

    this.PropertiesChanged({
      MapProperty: value
    });
  }

  @method({inSignature: 's', outSignature: 's'})
  Echo(what) {
    return what;
  }

  @method({inSignature: 'ss', outSignature: 'vv'})
  ReturnsMultiple(what, what2) {
    return [
      new Variant('s', what),
      new Variant('s', what2)
    ];
  }

  @method({inSignature: '', outSignature: ''})
  ThrowsError() {
    throw new MethodError('org.test.iface.Error', 'something went wrong');
  }

  @signal({signature: 's'})
  HelloWorld(value) {
    return value;
  }

  @signal({signature: 'ss'})
  SignalMultiple(x) {
    return [
      'hello',
      'world'
    ];
  }
}

let example = new ExampleInterface('org.test.iface');

setTimeout(() => {
  // emit the HelloWorld signal
  example.HelloWorld('hello');
}, 500);

bus.export('org.test.name',
           '/org/test/path',
           example);
```

Interfaces extend the `Interface` class. Declare service methods, properties, and signals with the decorators provided from the library. Then call `bus.export()` to export them onto the bus.

Methods are called when a DBus client calls that method on the server. Properties can be gotten and set with the `org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties` interface and are included in the introspection xml.

To emit a signal, just call the method marked with the `signal` decorator and the signal will be emitted with the returned value.

## The Client Interface

You can get a proxy object for a name on the bus with the `bus.getProxyObject()` function, passing the name and the path. The proxy object contains introspection data about the object including a list of nodes and interfaces. You can get an interface with the `object.getInterface()` function passing the name of the interface.

The interface object has methods you can call that correspond to the methods in the introspection data. Pass normal JavaScript objects to the parameters of the function and they will automatically be converted into the advertized DBus type. However, you must use the `Variant` class to represent DBus variants.

Methods will similarly return JavaScript objects converted from the advertised DBus type, with the `Variant` class used to represent returned variants. If the method returns multiple values, they will be returned within an array.

The interface object is an event emitter that will emit the name of a signal when it is emitted on the bus. Arguments to the callback should correspond to the arguments of the signal.

This is a brief example of using a proxy object with the [MPRIS](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/Player_Interface.html) media player interface.

```js
let dbus = require('dbus-next');
let bus = dbus.sessionBus();
let Variant = dbus.Variant;

// getting an object introspects it on the bus and creates the interfaces
let obj = await bus.getProxyObject('org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.vlc', '/org/mpris/MediaPlayer2');

// the interfaces are the primary way of interacting with objects on the bus
let player = obj.getInterface('org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player');
let properties = obj.getInterface('org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties');

// call methods on the interface
await player.Play()

// get properties with the properties interface (this returns a variant)
let volumeVariant = await properties.Get('org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player', 'Volume');
console.log('current volume: ' + volumeVariant.value);

// set properties with the properties interface using a variant
await properties.Set('org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player', 'Volume', new Variant('d', volumeVariant.value + 0.05));

// listen to signals
properties.on('PropertiesChanged', (iface, changed, invalidated) => {
  for (let prop of Object.keys(changed)) {
    console.log(`property changed: ${prop}`);
  }
});
```

For a complete example, see the [MPRIS client](https://github.com/acrisci/node-dbus-next/blob/master/examples/mpris.js) example which can be used to control media players on the command line.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. There's alot to do! Look at the issue tracker for [dbus-native](https://github.com/sidorares/dbus-native) for all those tricky bugs that require breaking the interface. I'll be pulling in a lot of outstanding pull requests from the project as well.

TODO:

* Redesign the client interface
* Complete implementation of the server interface
* Fix bugs
